# Pro type
> A typing game like no other!

## How this is made
> How this was all created

Pro typer was made in node js with express and ejs. The other materials used are: sendgrid (sending verification mails and such), monogoose (for database acsess to mongodb) , dotenv (setting up process.env) and nodemon (for testing the server `npm run dev`)

## Setting up the server
> Making this all run!

First you want to install all the modules used by doing `npm install`.
Now make a file called variables.env and copy sample-variables.env and change it with your details.
Start the server using the start or dev command:
Start the server: `npm start`
Start the server in developer mode (using nodemon): `npm run dev`
